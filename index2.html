                            <p> 
                                Brain cancer is one of the most challenging forms of oncological disease, characterised by the abnormal growth of cells in the brain, which can be benign or malignant. Among malignant tumours, glioblastoma multiforme stands out as one of the most aggressive and difficult to treat, with high mortality rates. The complexity of this type of cancer is largely due to the blood-brain barrier, which limits the effective delivery of drugs to the brain, as well as the tumours' resistance to conventional therapies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In this context, nanotechnologies, in combination with advanced gene editing techniques such as CRISPR/Cas9, have revolutionised the field of oncology, offering new possibilities for the treatment of brain tumours. Using nanoparticles that can cross the blood-brain barrier, it is possible to deliver gene editing tools directly to tumour cells, promoting the suppression of oncogenic genes and the activation of the body's natural defence mechanisms. In 2012, Doudna and Charpentier won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the development of CRISPR. Based on statistics from the National Brain Tumour Society, 78,000 patients are diagnosed with malignant brain tumours in the United States each year, and around 16,616 die from brain cancer.                                  <center>                                    <img src='hisyt.png' style='width:90%'>

                            <p>
                               A tecnologia CRISPR/Cas9 é uma ferramenta revolucionária de edição genética que permite modificações precisas e específicas no genoma, e tem sido amplamente aplicada no campo da biotecnologia, incluindo no tratamento de tumores, como o glioblastoma. O sistema CRISPR/Cas9 consiste em duas componentes principais que trabalham em conjunto para realizar alterações genéticas: o RNA guia (gRNA) e a proteína Cas9.O CRISPR/Cas9 utiliza um processo de edição genética baseado em um RNA guia (gRNA) que direciona a proteína Cas9 para uma sequência específica de DNA no genoma. A proteína Cas9 age como uma "tesoura molecular", realizando um corte preciso na dupla hélice do DNA na localização desejada. Após o corte, o sistema celular de reparo é ativado para corrigir a lesão no DNA. O reparo pode ocorrer de duas maneiras principais:<br>
                                
                                <b>1.	Junção de extremidades não homólogas (NHEJ): </b> Este processo de reparo frequentemente resulta em inserções ou eliminações que podem desativar genes, como aqueles envolvidos na progressão tumoral.
                                <br>
                                <b>2.	Recombinação homóloga (HDR):</b> Se uma sequência de DNA exógena for fornecida, o reparo pode ser feito com a inserção de genes específicos, o que pode ser usado para corrigir mutações patogênicas ou introduzir genes terapêuticos.
                            
                                <br><br>
                                Essa precisão torna o CRISPR/Cas9 uma ferramenta muito promissora no combate ao cancro, permitindo a modificação direta de genes que favorecem a proliferação de células tumorais. Em glioblastomas, por exemplo, genes como o EGFRvIII, frequentemente mutado, podem ser alvo de edição, ajudando a reduzir a capacidade do tumor crescer e se espalhar
                                 <br>
                                Uma das maiores limitações na aplicação clínica do CRISPR/Cas9 é a dificuldade de entregar as componentes do sistema CRISPR diretamente às células tumorais, especialmente devido à presença da barreira hematoencefálica. Para superar essa limitação, as nanopartículas desempenham um papel crucial como “transportadoras” dessas ferramentas moleculares.
                                <br>
                                As nanopartículas são projetadas para proteger o RNA guia e a proteína Cas9 da degradação, além de permitir a liberação controlada dessas moléculas no local alvo, dentro do tecido tumoral. Existem diferentes tipos de nanopartículas utilizadas para essa função, como nanopartículas lipídicas, poliméricas e metálicas, que podem ser modificadas para aumentar sua especificidade e eficiência.
                                 <br>
                                <b>a.	Direcionamento Específico:</b> As nanopartículas podem ser funcionalizadas com ligantes que reconhecem e se ligam a marcadores específicos presentes nas células tumorais. Isso permite que a entrega do CRISPR/Cas9 seja mais precisa, reduzindo os efeitos colaterais em tecidos saudáveis.
                                 <br>
                                 <b>b.	Liberação Controlada: </b> As nanopartículas também podem ser projetadas para liberar os componentes do CRISPR/Cas9 de maneira gradual ou em resposta a condições específicas do tumor, como o pH ou temperatura, maximizando a eficácia terapêutica.

                                <b>Study 1 - Stefanoudakis et al. (2023) </b>
                                <br>
                                Study Aim: This study focussed on the application of CRISPR/Cas9 technology for the treatment of glioblastoma, a highly aggressive type of brain cancer, using lipid nanoparticles to deliver the CRISPR system.
                                <br>What was done:
                                <br>- Animal Models: The study was conducted in murine models, which are often used to test experimental therapies due to their similarity to humans in terms of tumour growth.
                                <br>- Therapeutic Aim: The aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of gene editing in the treatment of glioblastomas, specifically aimed at reducing tumour growth and improving animal survival.
                                <br>How it was carried out:
                                <br>- Lipid nanoparticles: Lipid nanoparticles were used as vehicles to deliver the CRISPR/Cas9 system. These nanoparticles were chosen for their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, one of the greatest difficulties in treating brain tumours.
                                <br>- CRISPR/Cas9 and gRNA: A specific guide RNA (gRNA) sequence was used to target the Cas9 enzyme to the EGFRvIII gene, which is a common mutation in glioblastomas. The EGFRvIII gene is an important target for treatment, as its mutation is associated with the rapid growth and aggressiveness of the tumour.
                                <br>Results:
                                <br>- Reduction in Tumour Growth: After four weeks of treatment, the animals that received CRISPR/Cas9 with the lipid nanoparticles showed a reduction of more than 60% in tumour growth. This demonstrated that gene editing, when combined with efficient nanoparticle delivery, can be effective in reducing tumour volume.
                                <br>- Increased survival: In addition to the reduction in tumour growth, the animals treated with CRISPR/Cas9 showed a longer survival time compared to those that received conventional treatment (without CRISPR or nanoparticles).
                                <br>This study exemplifies the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 combined with nanotechnology as an effective strategy in the treatment of glioblastoma, mainly due to the ability of nanoparticles to cross the blood-brain barrier and deliver CRISPR directly to the tumour.

                                <br>Aim of the Study: The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of different types of nanoparticles in the treatment of brain cancer, with a focus on overcoming the blood-brain barrier and the specific delivery of therapeutic agents, including CRISPR/Cas9.
                                <br>What has been done:
                                <br>- Types of Nanoparticles: The researchers investigated the use of metallic nanoparticles coated with peptides, which are small molecules that can specifically bind to tumour cells, as delivery targets for CRISPR.
                                <br>- Glioblastoma models: The research was conducted on murine models of glioblastoma to assess the effectiveness of these nanoparticles in delivering CRISPR/Cas9 and other therapeutic agents directly to the brain.
                                <br>How it was carried out:
                                <br>- Nanoparticle development: Metallic nanoparticles were developed and modified to carry CRISPR/Cas9, along with peptides that would allow the nanoparticles to recognise and bind to specific receptors on tumour cells.
                                <br>- Controlled Delivery: The nanoparticles were designed to protect against early degradation in the body and allow for a controlled release of CRISPR/Cas9 directly into the tumour, aiming to minimise damage to healthy tissues.
                                <br>Results:
                                <br>- Efficient Delivery of CRISPR: The study demonstrated that peptide-coated metal nanoparticles were highly efficient at crossing the blood-brain barrier and reaching tumour cells. This was possible due to the modification of the nanoparticles, which had specific ligands for the markers present in the tumour cells.
                                <br>- Reduction in Tumour Volume: The results indicated that the nanoparticles were effective not only in delivering CRISPR, but also in significantly reducing tumour volume in the experimental models.
                                <br>- Low Toxicity: One of the important findings was that the metal nanoparticles did not cause significant damage to the animals' vital organs, which suggests that this approach is relatively safe, with low systemic toxicity.
                                <br>This study is significant for showing how the use of nanoparticles can be a viable solution for the treatment of brain cancer, by facilitating the delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 in a specific and controlled manner, without causing serious adverse effects.

                                <br>- Brain Tumour Models: The researchers used mouse models of human brain tumours, with the aim of developing a more accurate representation of the biological and molecular characteristics of these tumours for therapeutic trials.
                                <br>- Use of CRISPR/Cas9: CRISPR/Cas9 was applied to edit specific genes associated with the growth and aggressiveness of brain tumours, such as mutations in the TP53 and EGFR genes, which are often present in glioblastomas.
                                <br>How it was carried out:
                                <br>- Development of Tumour Models: The study made use of transgenic mouse models to simulate specific genetic mutations found in human glioblastomas. The genetic edits were targeted at key genes involved in tumour proliferation and resistance.
                                <br>- Improving the Accuracy of CRISPR/Cas9: To improve the accuracy of gene editing, new variants of the CRISPR/Cas9 system were investigated, such as the use of high-fidelity nucleases and the modification of guide RNA, in order to reduce off-target editing errors (off-target mutation).
                                <br>Results:
                                <br>- Accurate Gene Editing: The use of improved variants of the CRISPR/Cas9 system led to more accurate editing of target genes, with a significant reduction in off-target mutations.
                                <br>- Improved Brain Tumour Model: Modelling brain tumours using CRISPR/Cas9 was successful in better representing the molecular aspects of human glioblastomas. This enabled a more in-depth study of the mechanisms of resistance to treatment and tumour aggressiveness.
                                <br>- Therapeutic Potential: The study also discussed the future use of CRISPR/Cas9 for gene therapies, emphasising the importance of combining the system with more effective drug delivery approaches, such as nanoparticles, to overcome the blood-brain barrier.
                                <br><br>
                                This study provides a comprehensive overview of the use of CRISPR/Cas9 in modelling brain tumours and points to significant advances in the precision of gene editing.

                            <h2 id="act">Action Mechanisms </h2>
                            <p>
                                Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have several mechanisms of action that make them promising tools in the treatment of lung cancer, offering high specificity and efficacy when interacting with tumour cells. Among the main mechanisms are photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, controlled drug release, immunotherapy and gene therapy, as well as the possibility of theranostic applications, which combine diagnosis and treatment.
                                <br>Photothermal therapy (PTT) takes advantage of AuNPs' ability to absorb light in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength and convert it into heat. This localised heating, resulting from exposure to NIR lasers, destroys tumour cells by damaging proteins and nucleic acids, leading to cell death through necrosis or apoptosis. This method is especially advantageous due to its selectivity, as it preferentially targets tumour cells and preserves surrounding healthy tissue, making it an effective approach for treating solid lung tumours.
                                <br>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involves the functionalisation of AuNPs with photosensitising molecules which, when activated by light, produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) capable of oxidising essential cell structures, promoting the death of tumour cells. This method is useful for tumours that are resistant to conventional treatments, since ROS act independently of the signalling pathways that may be altered in cancer.
                                <br>Another relevant mechanism is the controlled release of drugs. AuNPs, functionalised with chemotherapy drugs, act as vectors for the targeted and gradual transport of the drugs to the tumour. This selective delivery allows the controlled release of the drugs in response to the acidic pH of the tumour microenvironment, concentrating the therapeutic action on the cancer cells and reducing side effects. In this way, AuNPs make it possible to maintain an effective concentration of the drug in the tumour over time, increasing the effectiveness of the treatment.
                                <br>AuNPs also have promising applications in immunotherapy, as they are functionalized with immunomodulatory molecules that stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells. The nanoparticles can carry tumour antigens that ‘teach’ the immune system to identify and destroy malignant cells. In the case of lung cancer, this approach aims to combat the immunosuppression characteristic of the tumour environment by activating an effective anti-tumour immune response.
                                <br>Another significant advance is the use of AuNPs in genetic therapies, such as the transport of interference RNA (siRNA) or DNA, aimed at silencing oncogenic genes or activating specific tumour suppressor genes. This mechanism allows for a personalised approach, with precise modification of gene expression in cancer cells, promoting cell death or inhibiting tumour progression in a targeted manner.
                                <br>In addition, AuNPs offer the possibility of theranostic application, integrating diagnosis and therapy in a single system. Functionalised with fluorescent or radioactive molecules, AuNPs can be used for real-time monitoring of the tumour, making it easier to follow the response to treatment and providing more precise therapeutic planning. Because they accumulate preferentially in the tumour, AuNPs provide information on the location and size of the tumour, allowing treatment to be adjusted as necessary.
                                <br>In summary, the mechanisms of action of AuNPs for the treatment of lung cancer encompass highly selective therapeutic and diagnostic methods, with the potential to improve treatment efficacy and reduce adverse effects. These approaches represent an important step forward in the development of safer and more personalised therapies, with promising prospects for the fight against lung cancer.

                            <p>
                                The functionalisation and bioconjugation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) has been prominent in the development of advanced therapies for the treatment of lung cancer, exploiting the unique properties of these particles, such as high stability, biocompatibility and energy conversion capacity. These modifications make AuNPs promising for the selective delivery of drugs and other therapies into the tumour environment, as well as offering less invasive and more effective therapeutic options.
                                 <br>The functionalisation process involves modifying the surface of nanoparticles to allow controlled interaction with cancer cells, ensuring specific and efficient delivery. Functionalisation strategies include the binding of specific molecules, such as antibodies and peptides, which recognise and bind to biomarkers expressed on lung cancer cells. This results in high selectivity, targeting treatment directly at tumour cells and reducing side effects on healthy tissues. 
                                 <br>Another approach is to modify the surface of the AuNPs with chemotherapy drugs, such as doxorubicin or paclitaxel, which are released directly into the cancer cells, increasing therapeutic efficacy and decreasing overall toxicity. 
                                 <br>In addition, coating the nanoparticles with biocompatible polymers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), can increase the stability of the nanoparticles in the body and improve their blood circulation, prolonging their time of action.
                                 <br>Bioconjugation, meanwhile, is the process of binding biomolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids or antibodies to the surface of AuNPs, facilitating their interaction with specific biological targets in the body. In the case of lung cancer, antibody bioconjugation allows the nanoparticles to identify and bind to specific membrane proteins of the cancer cells, facilitating the precise delivery of the therapy to the tumour. Similarly, bioconjugation with DNA or RNA opens up possibilities for genetic therapies that target specific mutations or gene silencing in cancer cells. Bioactive peptides are also frequently conjugated with AuNPs, enhancing the therapeutic effect, since some of these peptides have intrinsic anti-tumour properties.
                                 <br>These functionalized and bioconjugated nanoparticles have been used in innovative approaches for the treatment of lung cancer. Photothermal therapy (PTT) is one such strategy, in which AuNPs, when exposed to infrared laser light, convert this energy into heat and induce the destruction of tumour cells through hyperthermia. 
                                 <br>In short, the functionalisation and bioconjugation of gold nanoparticles represent significant advances in the search for more specific and effective treatments against lung cancer, making it possible to develop therapeutic approaches that combine innovation with less impact on the patient's general health.

                            <p>
                                Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) offer significant potential for the treatment of lung cancer, but their toxicity is a crucial aspect that needs to be carefully managed to ensure the safety and efficacy of the treatment. The toxicity of AuNPs depends on several factors, including size, shape, dose, surface functionalisation and exposure time. The size and shape of AuNPs influence their biodistribution and toxicity: smaller particles, with a diameter of less than 10 nm, tend to accumulate in organs such as the liver, spleen and kidneys, where elimination is more difficult and can cause toxic effects. In addition, AuNPs with spherical shapes generally have lower toxicity compared to those with other shapes, such as rods or stars, which makes it essential to develop AuNPs with optimised sizes and shapes to reduce toxicity and improve therapeutic efficacy.
                                <br>Another important factor is the functionalized surface of AuNPs. These are often modified with biocompatible molecules such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), which helps to reduce toxicity by preventing particle aggregation and decreasing recognition by the immune system. In contrast, AuNPs with negative or positive surface charges can interact more aggressively with the cell membrane, increasing toxicity. Therefore, careful functionalisation is essential to control toxicity, ensuring safer and more effective distribution in the body.
                                <br>The dose of AuNPs is one of the main determinants of toxicity. Higher doses can cause oxidative damage to cells, promoting the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause oxidative stress, leading to cell death in both cancerous and healthy cells. Adjusting the dose and applying it gradually or locally helps to reduce these toxic effects, increasing the safety of the treatment.
                                <br>The biodistribution and elimination of AuNPs also influence the level of toxicity. When administered, AuNPs tend to accumulate mainly in the liver and spleen, the main organs responsible for filtering and eliminating foreign particles. This retention can cause long-term damage, such as immunotoxic effects and chronic inflammation. For the treatment of lung cancer, the development of AuNPs with modifications that favour rapid elimination by the kidneys could be an effective strategy for reducing accumulated toxicity.
                                <br>Chronic toxicity is another important concern, since prolonged exposure to AuNPs can lead to subclinical effects such as alterations in liver function and the immune system, as well as a potential risk of genotoxic effects. Studies indicate that AuNPs can penetrate cells and interfere with DNA, depending on their characteristics, making long-term clinical trials essential to assess long-term safety. The development of biocompatible AuNPs, controlled release strategies and the customisation of nanoparticles based on the specific characteristics of each patient and tumour type are promising solutions for controlling toxicity and ensuring safer treatments.
                                <br>In summary, although AuNPs are promising in the treatment of lung cancer, their toxicity must be carefully managed. Optimisation of parameters such as size, shape, functionalised surface and dose, as well as in-depth studies on long-term effects, are essential to develop safer and more effective therapies. With continued advances in nanomedicine and detailed clinical trials, it will be possible to improve safety and personalise the use of AuNPs in the treatment of lung cancer.
