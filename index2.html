                            <p> 
                                Brain cancer is one of the most challenging forms of oncological disease, characterised by the abnormal growth of cells in the brain, which can be benign or malignant. Among malignant tumours, glioblastoma multiforme stands out as one of the most aggressive and difficult to treat, with high mortality rates. The complexity of this type of cancer is largely due to the blood-brain barrier, which limits the effective delivery of drugs to the brain, as well as the tumours' resistance to conventional therapies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In this context, nanotechnologies, in combination with advanced gene editing techniques such as CRISPR/Cas9, have revolutionised the field of oncology, offering new possibilities for the treatment of brain tumours. Using nanoparticles that can cross the blood-brain barrier, it is possible to deliver gene editing tools directly to tumour cells, promoting the suppression of oncogenic genes and the activation of the body's natural defence mechanisms. In 2012, Doudna and Charpentier won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the development of CRISPR. Based on statistics from the National Brain Tumour Society, 78,000 patients are diagnosed with malignant brain tumours in the United States each year, and around 16,616 die from brain cancer.                                  <center>                                    <img src='hisyt.png' style='width:90%'>

                               A tecnologia CRISPR/Cas9 é uma ferramenta revolucionária de edição genética que permite modificações precisas e específicas no genoma, e tem sido amplamente aplicada no campo da biotecnologia, incluindo no tratamento de tumores, como o glioblastoma. O sistema CRISPR/Cas9 consiste em duas componentes principais que trabalham em conjunto para realizar alterações genéticas: o RNA guia (gRNA) e a proteína Cas9.O CRISPR/Cas9 utiliza um processo de edição genética baseado em um RNA guia (gRNA) que direciona a proteína Cas9 para uma sequência específica de DNA no genoma. A proteína Cas9 age como uma "tesoura molecular", realizando um corte preciso na dupla hélice do DNA na localização desejada. Após o corte, o sistema celular de reparo é ativado para corrigir a lesão no DNA. O reparo pode ocorrer de duas maneiras principais:<br>
                                
                                1.	Junção de extremidades não homólogas (NHEJ): Este processo de reparo frequentemente resulta em inserções ou eliminações que podem desativar genes, como aqueles envolvidos na progressão tumoral.</li>
                                2.	Recombinação homóloga (HDR): Se uma sequência de DNA exógena for fornecida, o reparo pode ser feito com a inserção de genes específicos, o que pode ser usado para corrigir mutações patogênicas ou introduzir genes terapêuticos.</li>
                            
                                <br>
                                Essa precisão torna o CRISPR/Cas9 uma ferramenta muito promissora no combate ao cancro, permitindo a modificação direta de genes que favorecem a proliferação de células tumorais. Em glioblastomas, por exemplo, genes como o EGFRvIII, frequentemente mutado, podem ser alvo de edição, ajudando a reduzir a capacidade do tumor crescer e se espalhar

                            <p>
                                The production of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for the treatment of lung cancer involves a 
                                series of complex processes, with the aim of creating particles that are safe, effective 
                                and suitable for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. AuNPs are valued in nanomedicine 
                                due to their biocompatibility, stability and ability to functionalise with a variety of 
                                molecules, which allows for great versatility in cancer therapy. In order to be effective 
                                in the treatment of lung cancer, AuNPs must be carefully synthesised and prepared to 
                                ensure that they have the necessary characteristics to target tumour tissue precisely 
                                and safely. <br>
                                The first step in the production of AuNPs is the choice of synthesis method, which can 
                                be physical, chemical or biological. Chemical methods are the most common and use reducing 
                                agents to transform gold salts (such as gold chloride) into gold nanoparticles. In this 
                                process, the addition of stabilising agents is essential to control the size and shape of 
                                the nanoparticles and prevent them from aggregating. Chemical synthesis methods have the 
                                advantage of being fast and controllable, allowing the production of AuNPs with specific 
                                sizes and shapes, such as spheres, rods or stars, each with unique properties. Physical 
                                methods, such as evaporation and condensation, are less common due to high costs and the 
                                need for specialised equipment, but can be used to produce AuNPs of high purity. <br>
                                A promising approach is biological synthesis, which uses living organisms such as bacteria, 
                                fungi and plants to reduce gold salts and produce AuNPs. This method is considered more 
                                sustainable and less toxic, as it avoids the use of potentially dangerous chemical agents. 
                                In addition, AuNPs produced by biological methods tend to be biocompatible, a desirable 
                                characteristic for applications in medicine. However, control over the size and shape of 
                                the nanoparticles in this method is more difficult to achieve, which may limit their use 
                                in some specific applications. <br>
                                After synthesis, the AuNPs are functionalised to confer specific properties that improve 
                                their efficiency in the treatment of lung cancer. Functionalisation consists of adding 
                                bioactive molecules, such as drugs, antibodies or peptides, to the surface of the 
                                nanoparticles. This step is crucial as it allows the AuNPs to recognise and bind specifically 
                                to cancer cells, maximising the effectiveness of the treatment and minimising damage to 
                                healthy tissues. Functionalisation with polyethylene glycol (PEG), for example, is often
                                used to increase the biocompatibility of AuNPs and prolong their circulation in the body, 
                                avoiding early recognition by the immune system.<br>
                                In addition, the production of AuNPs for cancer treatment requires rigorous testing to 
                                guarantee the stability and safety of the nanoparticles. The characterisation of AuNPs, 
                                including analysis of their size, shape, surface charge and stability, is essential to 
                                confirm that they have the desired properties. Techniques such as electron microscopy, 
                                UV-vis spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering are often used to carry out these analyses. 
                                In vitro and in vivo tests are also needed to assess the effectiveness of AuNPs in eliminating 
                                cancer cells, their ability to penetrate tumour tissue and their toxicity to healthy cells.<br>
                                In short, the production of gold nanoparticles for the treatment of lung cancer is a process 
                                that requires precision and control over multiple stages, from synthesis to functionalisation 
                                and final characterisation. The ability to adjust the size, shape and surface of AuNPs makes 
                                it possible to adapt these particles to different therapeutic strategies, such as photothermal 
                                therapy and controlled drug release. With advances in production techniques and growing 
                                knowledge about the toxicity and biocompatibility of AuNPs, this approach represents a 
                                promising alternative for the treatment of lung cancer, with the potential to offer more 
                                effective, selective and less invasive treatments.

                            <h2 id="act">Action Mechanisms </h2>
                            <p>
                                Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have several mechanisms of action that make them promising tools in the treatment of lung cancer, offering high specificity and efficacy when interacting with tumour cells. Among the main mechanisms are photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, controlled drug release, immunotherapy and gene therapy, as well as the possibility of theranostic applications, which combine diagnosis and treatment.
                                <br>Photothermal therapy (PTT) takes advantage of AuNPs' ability to absorb light in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength and convert it into heat. This localised heating, resulting from exposure to NIR lasers, destroys tumour cells by damaging proteins and nucleic acids, leading to cell death through necrosis or apoptosis. This method is especially advantageous due to its selectivity, as it preferentially targets tumour cells and preserves surrounding healthy tissue, making it an effective approach for treating solid lung tumours.
                                <br>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involves the functionalisation of AuNPs with photosensitising molecules which, when activated by light, produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) capable of oxidising essential cell structures, promoting the death of tumour cells. This method is useful for tumours that are resistant to conventional treatments, since ROS act independently of the signalling pathways that may be altered in cancer.
                                <br>Another relevant mechanism is the controlled release of drugs. AuNPs, functionalised with chemotherapy drugs, act as vectors for the targeted and gradual transport of the drugs to the tumour. This selective delivery allows the controlled release of the drugs in response to the acidic pH of the tumour microenvironment, concentrating the therapeutic action on the cancer cells and reducing side effects. In this way, AuNPs make it possible to maintain an effective concentration of the drug in the tumour over time, increasing the effectiveness of the treatment.
                                <br>AuNPs also have promising applications in immunotherapy, as they are functionalized with immunomodulatory molecules that stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells. The nanoparticles can carry tumour antigens that ‘teach’ the immune system to identify and destroy malignant cells. In the case of lung cancer, this approach aims to combat the immunosuppression characteristic of the tumour environment by activating an effective anti-tumour immune response.
                                <br>Another significant advance is the use of AuNPs in genetic therapies, such as the transport of interference RNA (siRNA) or DNA, aimed at silencing oncogenic genes or activating specific tumour suppressor genes. This mechanism allows for a personalised approach, with precise modification of gene expression in cancer cells, promoting cell death or inhibiting tumour progression in a targeted manner.
                                <br>In addition, AuNPs offer the possibility of theranostic application, integrating diagnosis and therapy in a single system. Functionalised with fluorescent or radioactive molecules, AuNPs can be used for real-time monitoring of the tumour, making it easier to follow the response to treatment and providing more precise therapeutic planning. Because they accumulate preferentially in the tumour, AuNPs provide information on the location and size of the tumour, allowing treatment to be adjusted as necessary.
                                <br>In summary, the mechanisms of action of AuNPs for the treatment of lung cancer encompass highly selective therapeutic and diagnostic methods, with the potential to improve treatment efficacy and reduce adverse effects. These approaches represent an important step forward in the development of safer and more personalised therapies, with promising prospects for the fight against lung cancer.

                            <p>
                                The functionalisation and bioconjugation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) has been prominent in the development of advanced therapies for the treatment of lung cancer, exploiting the unique properties of these particles, such as high stability, biocompatibility and energy conversion capacity. These modifications make AuNPs promising for the selective delivery of drugs and other therapies into the tumour environment, as well as offering less invasive and more effective therapeutic options.
                                 <br>The functionalisation process involves modifying the surface of nanoparticles to allow controlled interaction with cancer cells, ensuring specific and efficient delivery. Functionalisation strategies include the binding of specific molecules, such as antibodies and peptides, which recognise and bind to biomarkers expressed on lung cancer cells. This results in high selectivity, targeting treatment directly at tumour cells and reducing side effects on healthy tissues. 
                                 <br>Another approach is to modify the surface of the AuNPs with chemotherapy drugs, such as doxorubicin or paclitaxel, which are released directly into the cancer cells, increasing therapeutic efficacy and decreasing overall toxicity. 
                                 <br>In addition, coating the nanoparticles with biocompatible polymers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), can increase the stability of the nanoparticles in the body and improve their blood circulation, prolonging their time of action.
                                 <br>Bioconjugation, meanwhile, is the process of binding biomolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids or antibodies to the surface of AuNPs, facilitating their interaction with specific biological targets in the body. In the case of lung cancer, antibody bioconjugation allows the nanoparticles to identify and bind to specific membrane proteins of the cancer cells, facilitating the precise delivery of the therapy to the tumour. Similarly, bioconjugation with DNA or RNA opens up possibilities for genetic therapies that target specific mutations or gene silencing in cancer cells. Bioactive peptides are also frequently conjugated with AuNPs, enhancing the therapeutic effect, since some of these peptides have intrinsic anti-tumour properties.
                                 <br>These functionalized and bioconjugated nanoparticles have been used in innovative approaches for the treatment of lung cancer. Photothermal therapy (PTT) is one such strategy, in which AuNPs, when exposed to infrared laser light, convert this energy into heat and induce the destruction of tumour cells through hyperthermia. 
                                 <br>In short, the functionalisation and bioconjugation of gold nanoparticles represent significant advances in the search for more specific and effective treatments against lung cancer, making it possible to develop therapeutic approaches that combine innovation with less impact on the patient's general health.

                            <h2 id="tox">Toxicity </h2>
                            <p>
                                Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) offer significant potential for the treatment of lung cancer, but their toxicity is a crucial aspect that needs to be carefully managed to ensure the safety and efficacy of the treatment. The toxicity of AuNPs depends on several factors, including size, shape, dose, surface functionalisation and exposure time. The size and shape of AuNPs influence their biodistribution and toxicity: smaller particles, with a diameter of less than 10 nm, tend to accumulate in organs such as the liver, spleen and kidneys, where elimination is more difficult and can cause toxic effects. In addition, AuNPs with spherical shapes generally have lower toxicity compared to those with other shapes, such as rods or stars, which makes it essential to develop AuNPs with optimised sizes and shapes to reduce toxicity and improve therapeutic efficacy.
                                <br>Another important factor is the functionalized surface of AuNPs. These are often modified with biocompatible molecules such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), which helps to reduce toxicity by preventing particle aggregation and decreasing recognition by the immune system. In contrast, AuNPs with negative or positive surface charges can interact more aggressively with the cell membrane, increasing toxicity. Therefore, careful functionalisation is essential to control toxicity, ensuring safer and more effective distribution in the body.
                                <br>The dose of AuNPs is one of the main determinants of toxicity. Higher doses can cause oxidative damage to cells, promoting the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause oxidative stress, leading to cell death in both cancerous and healthy cells. Adjusting the dose and applying it gradually or locally helps to reduce these toxic effects, increasing the safety of the treatment.
                                <br>The biodistribution and elimination of AuNPs also influence the level of toxicity. When administered, AuNPs tend to accumulate mainly in the liver and spleen, the main organs responsible for filtering and eliminating foreign particles. This retention can cause long-term damage, such as immunotoxic effects and chronic inflammation. For the treatment of lung cancer, the development of AuNPs with modifications that favour rapid elimination by the kidneys could be an effective strategy for reducing accumulated toxicity.
                                <br>Chronic toxicity is another important concern, since prolonged exposure to AuNPs can lead to subclinical effects such as alterations in liver function and the immune system, as well as a potential risk of genotoxic effects. Studies indicate that AuNPs can penetrate cells and interfere with DNA, depending on their characteristics, making long-term clinical trials essential to assess long-term safety. The development of biocompatible AuNPs, controlled release strategies and the customisation of nanoparticles based on the specific characteristics of each patient and tumour type are promising solutions for controlling toxicity and ensuring safer treatments.
                                <br>In summary, although AuNPs are promising in the treatment of lung cancer, their toxicity must be carefully managed. Optimisation of parameters such as size, shape, functionalised surface and dose, as well as in-depth studies on long-term effects, are essential to develop safer and more effective therapies. With continued advances in nanomedicine and detailed clinical trials, it will be possible to improve safety and personalise the use of AuNPs in the treatment of lung cancer.
