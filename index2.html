                                Brain cancer is one of the most challenging forms of oncological disease, characterised by the abnormal growth of cells in the brain, which can be benign or malignant. Among malignant tumours, glioblastoma multiforme stands out as one of the most aggressive and difficult to treat, with high mortality rates. The complexity of this type of cancer is largely due to the blood-brain barrier, which limits the effective delivery of drugs to the brain, as well as the tumours' resistance to conventional therapies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In this context, nanotechnologies, in combination with advanced gene editing techniques such as CRISPR/Cas9, have revolutionised the field of oncology, offering new possibilities for the treatment of brain tumours. Using nanoparticles that can cross the blood-brain barrier, it is possible to deliver gene editing tools directly to tumour cells, promoting the suppression of oncogenic genes and the activation of the body's natural defence mechanisms. In 2012, Doudna and Charpentier won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the development of CRISPR. Based on statistics from the National Brain Tumour Society, 78,000 patients are diagnosed with malignant brain tumours in the United States each year, and around 16,616 die from brain cancer.[1]

                                CRISPR/Cas9 technology is a revolutionary gene editing tool that allows precise and specific modifications to the genome, and has been widely applied in the field of biotechnology, including in the treatment of tumours such as glioblastoma. The CRISPR/Cas9 system consists of two main components that work together to make genetic changes: the guide RNA (gRNA) and the Cas9 protein.CRISPR/Cas9 uses a gene editing process based on a guide RNA (gRNA) that directs the Cas9 protein to a specific DNA sequence in the genome. The Cas9 protein acts like ‘molecular scissors’, making a precise cut in the DNA double helix at the desired location. After the cut, the cellular repair system is activated to correct the DNA damage. Repair can take place in two main ways:
                                <b>1. Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) </b> This repair process often results in insertions or deletions that can deactivate genes, such as those involved in tumour progression.
                                <br>
                                <b>2.	Homologous recombination (HDR):</b> If an exogenous DNA sequence is provided, repair can be carried out by inserting specific genes, which can be used to correct pathogenic mutations or introduce therapeutic genes.
                            
                                <br><br>
                                This precision makes CRISPR/Cas9 a very promising tool in the fight against cancer, allowing the direct modification of genes that favour the proliferation of tumour cells. In glioblastomas, for example, genes such as EGFRvIII, which is frequently mutated, can be edited, helping to reduce the tumour's ability to grow and spread
                                <br>
                                One of the biggest limitations in the clinical application of CRISPR/Cas9 is the difficulty of delivering the components of the CRISPR system directly to tumour cells, especially due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier. To overcome this limitation, nanoparticles play a crucial role as ‘carriers’ of these molecular tools.
                                <br>
                                The nanoparticles are designed to protect the guide RNA and Cas9 protein from degradation, as well as allowing the controlled release of these molecules at the target site within the tumour tissue. There are different types of nanoparticles used for this function, such as lipid, polymeric and metallic nanoparticles, which can be modified to increase their specificity and efficiency.
                                <br>
                                <b>a.	Specific Targeting:</b> As nanopartículas podem ser funcionalizadas com ligantes que reconhecem e se ligam a marcadores específicos presentes nas células tumorais. Isso permite que a entrega do CRISPR/Cas9 seja mais precisa, reduzindo os efeitos colaterais em tecidos saudáveis.
                                 <br>
                                 <b>b.	Controlled Release: </b> Nanoparticles can also be designed to release CRISPR/Cas9 components gradually or in response to specific tumour conditions, such as pH or temperature, maximising therapeutic efficacy.

                                <b>Study 1 - Stefanoudakis et al. (2023) </b>
                                <br>
                                Study Aim: This study focussed on the application of CRISPR/Cas9 technology for the treatment of glioblastoma, a highly aggressive type of brain cancer, using lipid nanoparticles to deliver the CRISPR system.
                                <br>What was done:
                                <br>- Animal Models: The study was conducted in murine models, which are often used to test experimental therapies due to their similarity to humans in terms of tumour growth.
                                <br>- Therapeutic Aim: The aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of gene editing in the treatment of glioblastomas, specifically aimed at reducing tumour growth and improving animal survival.
                                <br>How it was carried out:
                                <br>- Lipid nanoparticles: Lipid nanoparticles were used as vehicles to deliver the CRISPR/Cas9 system. These nanoparticles were chosen for their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, one of the greatest difficulties in treating brain tumours.
                                <br>- CRISPR/Cas9 and gRNA: A specific guide RNA (gRNA) sequence was used to target the Cas9 enzyme to the EGFRvIII gene, which is a common mutation in glioblastomas. The EGFRvIII gene is an important target for treatment, as its mutation is associated with the rapid growth and aggressiveness of the tumour.
                                <br>Results:
                                <br>- Reduction in Tumour Growth: After four weeks of treatment, the animals that received CRISPR/Cas9 with the lipid nanoparticles showed a reduction of more than 60% in tumour growth. This demonstrated that gene editing, when combined with efficient nanoparticle delivery, can be effective in reducing tumour volume.
                                <br>- Increased survival: In addition to the reduction in tumour growth, the animals treated with CRISPR/Cas9 showed a longer survival time compared to those that received conventional treatment (without CRISPR or nanoparticles).
                                <br>This study exemplifies the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 combined with nanotechnology as an effective strategy in the treatment of glioblastoma, mainly due to the ability of nanoparticles to cross the blood-brain barrier and deliver CRISPR directly to the tumour.

                                <b>Study 2 - Mukhtar et al. (2020) </b> 
                                <br>Aim of the Study: The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of different types of nanoparticles in the treatment of brain cancer, with a focus on overcoming the blood-brain barrier and the specific delivery of therapeutic agents, including CRISPR/Cas9.
                                <br>What has been done:
                                <br>- Types of Nanoparticles: The researchers investigated the use of metallic nanoparticles coated with peptides, which are small molecules that can specifically bind to tumour cells, as delivery targets for CRISPR.
                                <br>- Glioblastoma models: The research was conducted on murine models of glioblastoma to assess the effectiveness of these nanoparticles in delivering CRISPR/Cas9 and other therapeutic agents directly to the brain.
                                <br>How it was carried out:
                                <br>- Nanoparticle development: Metallic nanoparticles were developed and modified to carry CRISPR/Cas9, along with peptides that would allow the nanoparticles to recognise and bind to specific receptors on tumour cells.
                                <br>- Controlled Delivery: The nanoparticles were designed to protect against early degradation in the body and allow for a controlled release of CRISPR/Cas9 directly into the tumour, aiming to minimise damage to healthy tissues.
                                <br>Results:
                                <br>- Efficient Delivery of CRISPR: The study demonstrated that peptide-coated metal nanoparticles were highly efficient at crossing the blood-brain barrier and reaching tumour cells. This was possible due to the modification of the nanoparticles, which had specific ligands for the markers present in the tumour cells.
                                <br>- Reduction in Tumour Volume: The results indicated that the nanoparticles were effective not only in delivering CRISPR, but also in significantly reducing tumour volume in the experimental models.
                                <br>- Low Toxicity: One of the important findings was that the metal nanoparticles did not cause significant damage to the animals' vital organs, which suggests that this approach is relatively safe, with low systemic toxicity.
                                <br>This study is significant for showing how the use of nanoparticles can be a viable solution for the treatment of brain cancer, by facilitating the delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 in a specific and controlled manner, without causing serious adverse effects.

                                <b>Study 3 - Mao et al. (n.d.) </b>
                                <br>Aim of the Study: This study focused on the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system for modelling brain tumours, addressing the current state of the technology and prospects for the future in brain cancer treatment, with an emphasis on improving the accuracy and efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 delivery.
                                <br>What was done:
                                <br>- Brain Tumour Models: The researchers used mouse models of human brain tumours, with the aim of developing a more accurate representation of the biological and molecular characteristics of these tumours for therapeutic trials.
                                <br>- Use of CRISPR/Cas9: CRISPR/Cas9 was applied to edit specific genes associated with the growth and aggressiveness of brain tumours, such as mutations in the TP53 and EGFR genes, which are often present in glioblastomas.
                                <br>How it was carried out:
                                <br>- Development of Tumour Models: The study made use of transgenic mouse models to simulate specific genetic mutations found in human glioblastomas. The genetic edits were targeted at key genes involved in tumour proliferation and resistance.
                                <br>- Improving the Accuracy of CRISPR/Cas9: To improve the accuracy of gene editing, new variants of the CRISPR/Cas9 system were investigated, such as the use of high-fidelity nucleases and the modification of guide RNA, in order to reduce off-target editing errors (off-target mutation).
                                <br>Results:
                                <br>- Accurate Gene Editing: The use of improved variants of the CRISPR/Cas9 system led to more accurate editing of target genes, with a significant reduction in off-target mutations.
                                <br>- Improved Brain Tumour Model: Modelling brain tumours using CRISPR/Cas9 was successful in better representing the molecular aspects of human glioblastomas. This enabled a more in-depth study of the mechanisms of resistance to treatment and tumour aggressiveness.
                                <br>- Therapeutic Potential: The study also discussed the future use of CRISPR/Cas9 for gene therapies, emphasising the importance of combining the system with more effective drug delivery approaches, such as nanoparticles, to overcome the blood-brain barrier.
                                <br><br>
                                This study provides a comprehensive overview of the use of CRISPR/Cas9 in modelling brain tumours and points to significant advances in the precision of gene editing. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of improving delivery strategies to ensure that CRISPR/Cas9 reaches brain tumours effectively, opening doors to future personalised gene therapies against brain cancer.
